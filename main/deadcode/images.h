#ifndef NO_OLED
// OLED / menu images moved to deadcode
// Placeholder header — original image arrays were removed from the active build to keep this device headless.
// Arrays are archived elsewhere and can be restored manually if an OLED is added.

// This file contains large PROGMEM icon arrays (moved from mainmenu.ino)
// The device now runs without an OLED; these are retained for reference.
